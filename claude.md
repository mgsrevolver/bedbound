Project: The Listener - An Earthbound-Inspired Mobile RPG

Core Vision
A narrative-focused mobile RPG where you play a quiet child who progresses by listening to NPCs confess and share their stories. Inspired by Earthbound's suburban surrealism and Rachel Cusk's Outline trilogy.

The Core Insight: Children as Authentic Listeners
Adults talking to a child who simply nods and waits find themselves revealing truths they didn't plan to share. Children don't have conversational armor - they just listen, ask why, and repeat things back in ways that make adults hear themselves differently.

Target Audience
Non-gamers who rarely play beyond crosswords. Dead simple touch controls, no visible stats, 15-minute mobile sessions.

Core Mechanics
Universal 4-option dialogue system:
- "Say nothing" - Forces NPCs to fill uncomfortable silence
- "Nod" - Gentle encouragement without judgment
- "Ask why" - Innocent probing that cuts through deflection
- "Repeat back" - Makes adults hear themselves

The constraint isn't a limitation - it forces authentic interaction by removing conversational scripts.

Characters
Five NPCs with distinct psychological defense mechanisms:
- Paul: Projects his failings through legitimate-seeming complaints (divorce, curtains)
- Rita: Brilliant but unable to articulate her unified theory (failed academic, podcast obsession)
- Tatiana: Deflects sincerity through hostile humor (irony-poisoned troll, 4chan energy)
- Larry: Genuine spirituality hiding material privilege (meditation, mysterious wealth)
- Mark: Gets physical thrill from lying (replaced heroin with running and fabrication)

Dialogue Writing Philosophy
- Write how people really talk when they feel safely heard
- Every line serves psychological revelation
- Humor emerges from character specificity, not jokes
- Constraint breeds authenticity - limited options force honesty

Technical Notes
- Godot engine, mobile-first design
- Character data in JSON, separate from game logic
- Trust-based progression unlocks deeper conversations
- World expands as emotional barriers dissolve

Success Metric
The game works if players feel they're witnessing authentic psychological moments, not just consuming content.
